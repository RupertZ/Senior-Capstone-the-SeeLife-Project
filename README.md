Executive Summary: 
The goal of the SeeLife project is to produce an educational biofeedback game on mobile devices to help children at ages 6-8 overcome their anxiety and to teach them how to calm themselves down. To achieve this objective, we utilize the heart rate sensor and connect it to the device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection. On the other hand, the user interface is designed to be user-friendly and cartoonish. All of these features, including the wireless connection and the biofeedback mechanism, effectively train the children at ages 6-8. The heart rate data can be easily synchronized to computer database for further analysis and researches by parents and doctors.
